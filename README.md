**Facial recognition System**

The project "Système de Reconnaissance Faciale" was developed using deep learning techniques, specifically focusing on convolutional neural networks (CNN) for facial recognition. Key tools and libraries used include:

## Tools : 

- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) for image processing and facial recognition.
- **DeepFace Library**: Used for analyzing images and classifying them based on detected emotions.
- **Webcam Integration**: For capturing images in real-time, which are then stored and processed.
- **Image Processing**: Creation of bounding boxes around detected faces, reading and analyzing images from a dataset, and handling webcam feeds.
- **Python Libraries**: To support tasks such as model loading, dataset handling, and performing facial analysis based on a trained model.

## Conclusion
The project involves capturing and processing images, comparing them with a database of stored facial models to verify identities, and performing emotion detection​.
